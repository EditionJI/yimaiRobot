I will perform the following steps to submit your optimized code to the remote repository:

1.  **Cleanup**: Delete temporary debugging scripts `analyze_perf.py` and `debug_inventory.py` to keep the repository clean.
2.  **Git Commit**: Stage all changes in `rpa_bot.py` and commit them with a descriptive message like "Optimize RPA process: improve search input and button positioning efficiency".
3.  **Git Push**: Push the changes to the `main` branch of the remote repository (`https://github.com/EditionJI/yimaiRobot.git`).
